            The Democratic Republic of Congo’s tragedy spans decades of exploitation, dictatorship, and war. 
            Despite vast mineral wealth, civilians live under constant threat, with children growing up in the shadow of guns instead of schools.

    <!-- HISTORICAL BACKGROUND -->
    <!--<section>
        <h2>Historical Background</h2>
        <p>
            The Democratic Republic of Congo’s modern tragedy began long before headlines. Colonial rule,
            foreign exploitation, and violent power struggles created deep wounds that continue to shape
            reality today. After independence in 1960, the nation endured dictatorship, coups, and
            bloody civil wars that drew in neighboring states and countless armed factions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The result? A nation rich in minerals like coltan, cobalt, and gold — yet among the world’s
            poorest and most fragmented societies. Families displaced by conflict often see their children
            grow up under the shadow of guns instead of in schools. 
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- RESOURCE EXPLOITATION -->
    <section>
        <h2>Resource Exploitation</h2>
        <p>
            Congo’s wealth should be its blessing — but instead it’s become a curse. Competing armed groups,
            corrupt networks, and foreign interests exploit these resources for profit, fueling cycles of
            violence. Illegal mining operations, often controlled by militias, use forced and child labor,
            exposing communities to danger and deprivation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This isn’t abstract — behind every smartphone or electric vehicle battery that uses Congolese
            minerals are stories of displaced families, destroyed land, and futures stolen by war and greed.
            These are the hidden, human costs of global demand.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- ONGOING VIOLENCE -->
    <section>
        <h2>Ongoing Violence</h2>
        <p>
            Eastern provinces like North Kivu, Ituri, and South Kivu have seen rapid escalation in
            violence in recent years. Rebel factions such as M23 and the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF)
            continue brutal attacks on civilians, killing thousands and displacing millions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Children and women bear a disproportionate share of this violence — caught between armed groups,
            terrorized by raids, and vulnerable to sexual violence and forced recruitment. Hospitals overflow,
            communities fracture, and even ceasefire agreements collapse under renewed fighting.
        </p>

    <!-- HUMANITARIAN IMPACT -->
    <section>
        <h2>Humanitarian Impact</h2>
        <p>
            Today, more than **7 million Congolese are internally displaced**, forced from homes they
            once knew as safe. Many live in makeshift shelters — churches, schools, or under tarps —
            with no reliable food, water, or medical care. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
        </p>
        <p>
            Disease outbreaks, malnutrition, and lack of sanitation turn everyday life into a struggle
            against invisible enemies — long after bullets stop flying. Hospitals stretch beyond capacity,
            while humanitarian aid struggles to reach the frontlines of conflict zones.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some attacks have been especially horrific — including reports of mass atrocities and gender‑based
            violence that defy understanding. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SURVIVOR VOICES -->
    <section>
        <h2>Survivor's Voices</h2>
        
        <p>
            **Ana**, speaking from Beni after escaping brutal assault:  
            “They pretended they were protecting us. Then they beat us, they raped us, and they threatened to
            throw us into the lake. I thought I would never live again.”  
            Without money, medical help was a distant dream.
        </p>

        <p>
            **Paluku**, a 12‑year‑old boy, survived captivity with rebels. “We suffered terribly,” he said
            of life in remote camps where children were forced into labor and survival became a daily fight.
        </p>

        <p>
            **Madeleine** lost her children in a village attack. “I did not have the strength anymore,” she
            recalls, describing how violence tore her family apart.
        </p>

        <p>
            These are not statistics — these are real people whose lives have been reshaped by conflict,
            trauma, and loss. Their courage to speak out is a testament to human resilience, yet their need
            remains urgent.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- HUMAN RIGHTS -->
    <section>
        <h2>Human Rights Under Attack</h2>
        <p>
            According to human rights organizations, abuses in eastern Congo include arbitrary detention,
            torture, forced displacement, and gender‑based violence. Children are increasingly recruited
            into armed groups, denied education, and exposed to life‑altering trauma.
        </p>
        <p>
            These abuses violate international law and the most basic human rights — yet justice remains
            distant for millions. The cycle of violence cannot end without accountability and protection
            for civilians.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- WAYS TO HELP -->
    <section>
        <h2>Ways to Help</h2>
