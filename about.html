            <h2>What is AGI?</h2>
            <p>
                The Anti-Genocide Information (AGI) website is a humanitarian and educational initiative created to inform, educate, and inspire people about genocides—both historical and ongoing—across the world.
                In an era where information spreads rapidly but truth often gets buried in the noise, AGI stands as a responsible digital platform that presents verified facts, historical context, and real human consequences of genocide.
            </p>
            <p>
                Genocide is not just a historical term confined to textbooks; it is a painful reality that continues to affect millions of innocent lives today. 
                From Palestine to Sudan, from Congo to Myanmar, entire communities face systematic violence, displacement, and denial of basic human rights. 
                AGI aims to bring these realities into focus by presenting them with accuracy, sensitivity, and respect—ensuring that stories are not forgotten and voices are not silenced.
            </p>
            <p>
                This platform is designed especially for students, educators, researchers, and global citizens who seek reliable information and meaningful understanding.
                AGI does not aim to shock, but to educate; not to overwhelm, but to guide; and not merely to inform, but to encourage responsible awareness and action.
                Because understanding injustice is the first step toward preventing it.

            <h2>Why AGI exists?</h2>
            <p>
                Despite living in the age of technology and instant access to information, knowledge about genocide remains scattered, inconsistent, and often distorted. 
                Many people care deeply about humanitarian crises, yet they struggle to find trustworthy sources that clearly explain what is happening, why it is happening, and how they can genuinely help.
            </p>
            <p>
                AGI exists to fill this critical gap. It provides a centralized, authentic, and well-organized platform where users can learn about genocides through verified sources, structured timelines, and clear explanations. 
                Instead of searching across countless websites and social media posts, AGI offers one reliable starting point for awareness, learning, and responsible engagement.
            </p>
            <p> 
                More importantly, AGI exists because silence enables injustice. When people are informed, they become aware; when they are aware, they develop empathy; and when empathy is combined with knowledge, it leads to meaningful action.
                AGI is built on the belief that education is not passive—it is powerful.

            <p>
                 Preventing genocide relies on early action, informed decisions, and credible information. 
            We use only verified, trusted sources—such as official reports, academic research, and recognized humanitarian organizations—to ensure accuracy. 
            By combining reliable data with strong prevention strategies and policy guidance, we aim to protect vulnerable communities, raise awareness, and support timely, effective interventions before atrocities occur.
