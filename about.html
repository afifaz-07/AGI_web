    <!-- DEFINITION -->
    <section>
        <h2>Definition of Genocide (United Nations)</h2>
        <p>
            Genocide is one of the gravest crimes known to humanity, not because of its scale alone,
            but because of its intent. The United Nations defines genocide as acts committed with the
            deliberate purpose of destroying, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or
            religious group. These acts include killing, causing severe physical or psychological harm,
            deliberately creating conditions meant to end life, preventing births, and forcibly
            taking children from their communities.
        </p>

        <p>
            This definition exists to protect humanity from denial and excuses. Genocide is not an
            accident of war, nor a matter of perspective—it is a conscious decision to erase lives,
            identities, and futures. When the world fails to recognize genocide for what it is, it does
            not merely misunderstand history; it becomes complicit in allowing suffering to continue.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- CAUSES -->
    <section>
        <h2>Causes of Genocide</h2>
        <p>
            Genocide begins long before violence is visible. It starts when hatred is tolerated,
            when discrimination is ignored, and when certain lives are quietly declared less valuable
            than others. Political power, fear-driven narratives, and manipulated ideologies slowly
            strip groups of their dignity, turning neighbors into enemies and human beings into targets.
        </p>

        <p>
            When lies replace truth and silence replaces courage, genocide finds space to grow.
            History teaches us that genocide is not inevitable—it is enabled. It occurs when injustice
            is normalized and when society chooses comfort over confrontation. Understanding these
            causes is not about blaming the past; it is about protecting the future.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- IMPACTS -->
    <section>
        <h2>Impacts of Genocide</h2>
        <p>
            The impact of genocide reaches far beyond the loss of life. It shatters families, erases
            cultures, and leaves wounds that time alone cannot heal. Survivors carry trauma that shapes
            generations—memories of loss, fear, and displacement that become part of identity itself.
        </p>

        <p>
            Entire communities are left without homes, safety, or a sense of belonging. Children grow
            up surrounded by absence—of parents, of language, of tradition. Even when violence ends,
            the silence it leaves behind speaks of everything that was taken and can never be fully
            restored.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- AWARENESS & PREVENTION -->
    <section>
        <h2>Why Awareness and Prevention Matter</h2>
        <p>
            Awareness is not sympathy—it is responsibility. Every genocide in history was preceded by
            warning signs: hate-filled language, discrimination, dehumanization, and global
            indifference. These signs were seen, yet often ignored. Prevention fails not because people
            do not know, but because they choose not to act.
        </p>

        <p>
            Education has the power to interrupt this cycle. When individuals understand how genocide
            begins and why it continues, they are more likely to challenge false narratives, demand
            justice, and protect human dignity. Awareness does not end suffering instantly, but silence
            guarantees its survival. AGI exists because remembering, learning, and speaking out are the
            first acts of resistance against injustice.
