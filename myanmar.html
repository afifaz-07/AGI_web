            Myanmar’s history is marked by colonial rule, civil war, and authoritarianism. 
            Ethnic minorities face recurring violence, and the 2021 military coup crushed the brief hopes of democratic reform.

    <!-- HISTORICAL BACKGROUND -->
    <!--<section>
        <h2>Historical Background</h2>
        <p>
            Myanmar’s history has been shaped by long periods of colonial occupation, civil war, and
            authoritarian rule. Since gaining independence in 1948, ethnic minorities have been
            marginalized and subjected to recurring armed conflicts, particularly in Rakhine, Kachin,
            and Shan states.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although brief democratic reforms in 2011–2020 raised hope, the military coup of February 2021
            overturned progress, plunging the nation back into repression and instability.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- RESOURCE & POLITICAL EXPLOITATION -->
    <section>
        <h2>Resource & Political Exploitation</h2>
        <p>
            Myanmar is rich in jade, rubies, timber, and gas. Yet wealth from these resources rarely benefits
            local communities. Military control over mines and infrastructure has fueled corruption, funding
            armed operations and sustaining cycles of oppression.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ethnic minorities are often forcibly displaced from resource-rich areas to enable extraction,
            leaving them vulnerable to hunger, disease, and violence. International trade indirectly
            sustains these operations, making global consumers part of the problem.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- ONGOING VIOLENCE -->
    <section>
        <h2>Ongoing Violence</h2>
        <p>
            Armed clashes between the military and ethnic armed organizations continue across northern
            and western regions. Civilians face indiscriminate shelling, landmines, and targeted attacks.
            Families are forced to flee with minimal belongings, often trekking days to reach temporary
            shelters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reports of extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, and the burning of villages are widespread,
            leaving communities traumatized and uncertain of survival.
        </p>

    <!-- HUMANITARIAN IMPACT -->
    <section>
        <h2>Humanitarian Impact</h2>
        <p>
            Over 1 million people remain internally displaced, living in overcrowded camps or hiding in
            forests to escape conflict. Food insecurity, lack of clean water, and limited medical access
            create life-threatening conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Children face interrupted education, malnutrition, and psychological trauma. Women are
            disproportionately affected by violence and displacement. The humanitarian response is
            insufficient due to insecurity and restricted access for aid organizations.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SURVIVOR VOICES -->
    <section>
        <h2>Survivor's Voices</h2>
        <p>
            **Hlaing**, a displaced farmer from Sagaing:  
            “We left everything behind. The soldiers came at dawn. My neighbors are gone. My children
            cry every night. We have nowhere to sleep.” 
        </p>

        <p>
            **Aye Thandar**, a young mother:  
            “The village was burned. We walked for days to reach a temporary shelter. I worry every
            moment about food and water for my children.” 
        </p>

        <p>
            **Ko Tun**, an elderly man from Kachin state:  
            “We survive day by day. The world must know what is happening to us. Silence is killing us.”  
            These voices reflect the daily struggle of millions trapped between violence and neglect.
        </p>
