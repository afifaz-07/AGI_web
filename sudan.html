    <!-- BACKGROUND -->
    <section>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Sudan’s suffering did not begin in 2023. For decades, the country has endured military rule,
            political instability, economic exploitation, and regional neglect. Hopes for democracy
            after the 2019 uprising were slowly crushed as armed factions retained power, weapons,
            and control over national resources.
        </p>

        <p>
            What followed was not just political failure, but a complete collapse of civilian safety.
            Ordinary people—teachers, farmers, children—became trapped between armed groups fighting
            for control, wealth, and influence, while the world largely looked away.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Historical Timeline</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1989–2019:</strong> Decades of authoritarian rule and internal conflicts.</li>
            <li><strong>2019:</strong> Popular uprising removes Omar al-Bashir; hopes for civilian rule rise.</li>
            <li><strong>2021:</strong> Military coup derails democratic transition.</li>

    <!-- CURRENT REALITY -->
    <section>
        <h2>The Current Reality</h2>
        <p>
            Since the outbreak of war, Sudan has descended into chaos. Entire cities have been looted,
            bombed, and burned. Hospitals were attacked or shut down. Markets turned into mass graves.
            Millions of civilians were forced to flee their homes with nothing but fear.
        </p>

        <p>
            Reports from Darfur and other regions describe targeted killings, sexual violence,
            and ethnic cleansing. Families have been executed in their homes. Children have watched
            their parents die. These are not isolated incidents—they are patterns of brutality.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, Sudan faces famine-like conditions. Clean water is scarce. Aid is blocked.
            Disease spreads faster than help arrives. Survival itself has become an act of resistance.
        </p>

    <!-- GOLD & WAR ECONOMY -->
    <section>
        <h2>War Fueled by Gold</h2>
        <p>
            Sudan is rich in gold, yet its people live in extreme poverty. Control over gold mines has
            become a key driver of violence. Armed groups profit while civilians pay the price.
        </p>

        <p>
            International investigations and reports have linked Sudanese gold exports to global
            supply chains, raising serious concerns about how conflict resources are traded and who
            benefits from them. While profits flow outward, Sudanese communities are left destroyed.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is not just a civil war—it is a business built on blood, displacement, and silence.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SURVIVOR VOICES -->
    <section>
        <h2>Survivors Speak</h2>
        <p>
            “They came at night,” said a survivor from Darfur. “They burned our homes, shot my brother,
            and took everything. We ran barefoot. My mother did not survive the journey.”
        </p>

        <p>
            Another displaced woman shared: “The world talks about peace, but no one hears us.
            We are dying slowly—not just from bullets, but from hunger and abandonment.”
        </p>

        <p>
            These voices represent millions. Their pain is real, documented, and ongoing.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- HUMAN RIGHTS -->
    <section>
        <h2>Human Rights Under Attack</h2>
        <p>
            International organizations have warned that war crimes and crimes against humanity
            may be taking place in Sudan. Civilian protection has collapsed, and accountability
            remains absent.
        </p>

        <p>
            When massacres go unanswered and ceasefires fail repeatedly, violence becomes normalized.
            Silence, in this context, is not neutral—it is deadly.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- HOW TO HELP -->
    <section>
        <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
        <p>
            Sudan is facing one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world—and one of the least
            reported. Awareness matters, but action saves lives.
        </p>
