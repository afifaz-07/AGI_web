    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <section class="intro">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The Anti-Genocide Information (AGI) website is a humanitarian and educational initiative
            created to inform, educate, and inspire people about genocides—both historical and
            ongoing—across the world. In an era where information spreads rapidly but truth often
            gets lost, AGI stands as a responsible digital platform that presents verified facts,
            historical context, and real human consequences of genocide.
        </p>

        <p>
            Genocide is not just a historical term confined to textbooks; it is a painful reality
            that continues to affect millions of innocent lives today. From Palestine to Sudan,
            from Congo to Myanmar, entire communities face systematic violence, displacement, and
            denial of basic human rights. AGI aims to bring these realities into focus by presenting
            them with accuracy, sensitivity, and respect—ensuring that stories are not forgotten
            and voices are not silenced.
        </p>

        <p>
            This platform is designed especially for students, educators, researchers, and global
            citizens who seek reliable information and meaningful understanding. AGI does not aim
            to shock, but to educate; not to overwhelm, but to guide; and not merely to inform, but
            to encourage responsible awareness and action. Because understanding injustice is the
            first step toward preventing it.

    <!-- WHY AGI EXISTS -->
    <section class="why-agi">
        <h2>Why AGI Exists</h2>
        <p>
            Despite living in the age of technology and instant access to information, knowledge
            about genocide remains scattered, inconsistent, and often distorted. Many people care
            deeply about humanitarian crises, yet they struggle to find trustworthy sources that
            clearly explain what is happening, why it is happening, and how they can genuinely help.
        </p>

        <p>
            AGI exists to fill this critical gap. It provides a centralized, authentic, and
            well-organized platform where users can learn about genocides through verified sources,
            structured timelines, and clear explanations. Instead of searching across countless
            websites and social media posts, AGI offers one reliable starting point for awareness,
            learning, and responsible engagement.
        </p>

        <p>
            More importantly, AGI exists because silence enables injustice. When people are informed,
            they become aware; when they are aware, they develop empathy; and when empathy is
            combined with knowledge, it leads to meaningful action. AGI is built on the belief that
            education is not passive—it is powerful.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- MISSION -->
    <section class="mission">
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            The mission of AGI is to promote awareness, empathy, and responsibility by providing
            accurate and research-based information on genocide and crimes against humanity. The
            platform aims to educate users while encouraging critical thinking, compassion, and
            global responsibility.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>To spread awareness about past and ongoing genocides</li>
            <li>To promote peace, justice, and universal human rights</li>
            <li>To combat misinformation through verified sources</li>
            <li>To educate students and researchers with reliable content</li>
            <li>To encourage humanitarian action such as advocacy, donations, and volunteering</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            AGI believes that informed youth can shape a more just future. By transforming concern
            into understanding and understanding into action, AGI aspires to contribute to a world
            where human dignity is protected and remembered.
