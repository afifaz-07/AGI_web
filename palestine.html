            Decades of displacement, occupation, and denied rights define the Palestinian struggle. 
            Generations live under blockade and constant threat, with limited access to basic needs—a harsh

    <!-- BACKGROUND -->
   <!--<section class="section-container">
    <div class="section-text">
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            The Palestinian struggle is not defined by a single year or a single war. It is the result
            of decades of displacement, military occupation, and denial of fundamental human rights.
            Since the mid-20th century, Palestinians have faced systematic land loss, restricted movement,
            and repeated cycles of violence that have reshaped every aspect of civilian life.
        </p>

        <p>
            Generations have grown up under occupation, blockade, or refugee status, where safety is
            uncertain and basic freedoms are limited. For many Palestinians, daily existence involves
            checkpoints, surveillance, restricted access to healthcare and education, and the constant
            threat of displacement. This reality did not emerge overnight—it has been constructed
            gradually, through policy, force, and prolonged international inaction.

    <!-- OCTOBER 2023 & CURRENT REALITY -->
        <section class="section-container">
    <div class="section-text">
        <h2>October 2023 and the Ongoing Reality</h2>
        <p>
            October 2023 marked one of the deadliest and most destructive periods in recent Palestinian
            history. Entire neighborhoods in Gaza were reduced to rubble, hospitals were overwhelmed,
            and hundreds of thousands of civilians were forcibly displaced within days. The scale of
            destruction drew global attention, yet for Palestinians, it was an intensification of a
            reality they had endured for years.
        </p>

        <p>
            Although ceasefires were announced, they proved fragile and repeatedly violated. Airstrikes,
            ground operations, and blockades continued, undermining claims of de-escalation. Each
            “pause” in violence became temporary relief rather than a path to safety, leaving civilians
            trapped between uncertainty and fear.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, Gaza remains on the brink of humanitarian collapse. Access to clean water, food,
            electricity, and medical care is critically limited. Families live in overcrowded shelters,
            mourning the loss of loved ones while fearing the next violation of a ceasefire that was
            meant to protect them.
        </p>
         </div>
    </section>

    <!-- HUMAN RIGHTS -->
        <section class="section-container">
    <div class="section-text">
        <h2>Human Rights Violations</h2>
        <p>
            International human rights organizations and UN bodies have documented serious violations
            of international humanitarian law in Palestine. These include collective punishment,
            disproportionate use of force, destruction of civilian infrastructure, arbitrary detention,
            and forced displacement.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ceasefires that are repeatedly violated erode trust and deepen suffering. When accountability
            is absent and civilian protection is treated as optional, violence becomes normalized.
            Human rights are not negotiable, and their continued violation represents a failure not
            only of policy, but of moral responsibility.

    <!-- SURVIVOR VOICE -->
        <section class="section-container">
    <div class="section-text">
        <h2>A Survivor’s Voices</h2>
        <p>
            “When they announced a ceasefire, my children finally slept,” said a displaced father from
            Gaza. “But the bombs returned. Now they ask me why ceasefire means nothing. I have no answer
            for them.”
        </p>

        <p>
            Such testimonies reveal the psychological toll of repeated violence and broken promises.
            Survival in Palestine is not only about staying alive—it is about enduring uncertainty,
            loss, and the constant fear that safety will again be taken away.
